# word-by-word

**ADHD-friendly text reader.**

`word-by-word` is a simple, distraction-free desktop app that displays a plain text file *one word at a time*. You can adjust the speed (in milliseconds per word) and text size, helping you stay engaged while reading. Designed with love for folks with ADHDâ€”or anyone who finds it hard to stay focused on long paragraphs.

## Why?

Reading long blocks of text can be difficult for people with ADHD, as attention often drifts or shifts too quickly. This tool takes a different approach: by showing just one word at a time (and fast!!), it creates a sense of novelty and momentum that keeps your brain engaged.

The idea was inspired by a demo video showcasing a similar application, originally designed to illustrate that the brain reads faster than it can see by predicting upcoming words rather than visually processing each one in detail. That concept stuck with me, and I wanted to turn it into something usable.
